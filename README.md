## AssemblyScript32

Simple 32-bit assembly-like script language.

Suitable when:
- resource-limited device, such as MCU
- state synchronization required scenarios
- stable, high-performance, and unlimited script language (hint on Westwood Ra2 shitty trigger system)

demo:
```C++
#include "AS32_demo.h"
asc_testmain();
```

todo:
- shorter 8-bit instructions and operand code (It will make the C++ source more complicated and need more test)
